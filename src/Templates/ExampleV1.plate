    Merchant operates a business wherein it accepts credit and debit
    cards and other forms of electronic payments from customers.  Cynergy
    provides credit and debit card processing and other electronic
    payment processing services for various business clients.   Merchant
    is a client of Cynergy pursuant to that certain merchant processing
    application and agreement between Merchant and Cynergy, which may
    include, among other things, the merchant services terms and
    conditions and program guide, together with schedules, amendments and
    other documents related thereto (collectively, the &ldquo;Merchant
    Agreement&rdquo;).  Under the Merchant Agreement, Cynergy processes
    credit and debit card and other electronic payment transactions and
    remits applicable funds related to such transactions to Merchant (the
    &ldquo;Payment Proceeds&rdquo;).  Merchant needs capital funding to
    operate and/or expand its business.  Funding Provider is in the
    business of providing capital funding services to help merchants
    operate and/or expand their businesses.   Merchant desires to receive
    funding from Funding Provider in accordance with the terms of the
    funding agreement between Funding Provider and Merchant (the &ldquo;Funding
    Agreement&rdquo;). Pursuant to the Funding Agreement, Merchant has
    either sold to Funding Provider certain receivables, or Funding
    Provider has advanced funds to Merchant, and, in connection
    therewith, Merchant has agreed to pay to Funding Provider <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">_____</SPAN><B>%</B>

    Merchant Agreement. A copy of the Funding Agreement is attached
    hereto as <U>Exhibit &ldquo;A&rdquo;</U>.</P>
